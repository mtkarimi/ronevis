😭 **69,353 Lines of Code**: More than just a tally, it embodies the essence of dedication and perseverance. This figure represents the physical toll on my body, countless sleepless nights, and relentless coding marathons of up to 16 hours a day over half a year. It's a journey marked by pain yet invaluable growth. Cherish what I've shared; it's a testament to hard-earned progress.
